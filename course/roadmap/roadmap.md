\*\* core

- we keep track of all the concepts. Here is an example:

  - the string data type
  - how to declare a function
  - how to write an inline comment
  - the split method

  Each of these concepts have dependencies. So, if someone wanted to learn about method, they would know that they have to also learn about prototypal inheritence

- Every lesson has more explanations if you opt for the longer option

- Throughout make sure that they understand how the program works line by line

- a why aren't my styles working section. Basically there will be an external stylesheet that is imported that the user can't see, and they have to use the debugger to figure out what's going wrong. For example, a style is getting overridden, the property is invalid, etc.

## ideas base

- SRS
- You can select a category or tag to show up in your srs
- you can select an individual exercise to show up in your srs

- Maybe there are different difficult levels? Each problem has a maximum difficulty level (an easy problem won't show up if a user has medium difficulty selected)

- there are also different kinds of tags such as terminology, that a user can enable. An example would be, what does the word initialization mean?

- We could have different sections: tasks, concepts, terminology

- Open source!!! Other people could create modules that teach their technology

- lots of a/b testing

- calculate a tree with data visualization like in civilization or kingdom rush where you can't get the last upgrade until you get the earlier ones

- You can go to the store with the points you earn

- motivational quotes while loading

- you can make a goal for what you want to build and it will create a map (the data visualization thing) of the skills and preparation (the level you have to get to within those skills as well!) to achieve it

- dynamic pacing (pacing that adjust to how easily you get the answers)

- profiles of common mistakes in mentality/learning process that other learns had

- can add custom flashcards to their srs

- trainer page for current lesson

- perhaps there are specfic debugging exercises, and users can set how many debugging exercises they'd like in their daily exercise settings

- When you complete a sublesson/lesson, to the right of the 'Next' Button is a "Do more exercises" button

  - in the data strucutre for a sublesson shoudl be a "additional recommended lessons" field

- have a react foundations/prep course

- every exercise shows you which things you improved on (so if you did something with objects, the objects module would be improved)

- each exercise you can toggle different levels of explanation depth: brief, code only, to in depth or something

- a quiz you take that shows which skills you have

- different kind of quiz modes, like in quizlet with timed and other mini-games

- don't follow free code camp's lesson style, instead have a sort of developing lesson, that has some text, then leads to a question, then some more text, then question. And then on the left side of the screen you have a like a cheatsheet that has bullet points for the points you've introduced.

  - OH AND THERE SHOULD BE LIKE A PROGRESS BAR LIKE IN DUOLINGO. And that would work perfectly with the final exercises too!

- IT WOULD BE Great if the lesson view would also dedicate a small amount of real estate to show their current track.

- the tracker should also have like 3/10 thing at the bottom

## ideas round 2

- SRS

- line by line understanding

- trainer page for current lesson

- each exercise you can toggle different levels of explanation depth: brief, code only, to in depth or something

- don't follow free code camp's lesson style, instead have a sort of developing lesson, that has some text, then leads to a question, then some more text, then question. And then on the left side of the screen you have a like a cheatsheet that has bullet points for the points you've introduced.

  - OH AND THERE SHOULD BE LIKE A PROGRESS BAR LIKE IN DUOLINGO. And that would work perfectly with the final exercises too!

- IT WOULD BE Great if the lesson view would also dedicate a small amount of real estate to show their current track.

- the tracker should also have like 3/10 thing at the bottom

- Each lesson has a set of (probably hidden) tags that represent the skills learned

- you can do a review for any lesson. By that I think I just mean review exercises. But WAIT. ACTUALLY IT WOULD BE AWESOME IF WHEN YOU REVIEW A LESSON YOU HAVE THE OPTION TO GO THROUGH IT AGAIN, OR SEE LIKE A SUMMARY SUBLESSON. AND MAYBE IT WOULD BE GOOD TO HAVE THE SUMMARY AT THE END OF EACH LESSON

- comments section for each exercises/sublesson... you can upvote comments

- users can suggest changes to lesson

- accountability buddy

  - When you do a lesson you can maybe see how many exercises your buddy did or something

- We can sometimes tie a part of a lesson to a flashcard, so for example, on the 'renaming variables' lesson we say the rules of naming a variable. It would be cool if the user would see like an 'add to flashcard' button and a flashcard is automatically made for that.

- scratch paper? functionally no different than writing comments but I have a feeling like it will be adopted a lot more

  - in that same vein there is an option to see a 'hint'. You can look at our pseudocode

- should there be a skip button on challenges?

- faq for some sublessons. For example, on variables, some people might be like, 'why are they using var?'

- you can highlight parts of a lesson and you'll see it in the recap

- when they click next on the final sublesson, a modal will popup that is like. You have completed the sublessson! Choose what to do next: and the optiosn will be

  - "view recap/summary" - which will popup another, much larger modal with the summary
  - "practice this lesson with exercises" - need to come up with a better name. This wouldn't be available if there aren't enough exercises
  - "next lesson"
  - "back to course map" - not sure if this should be included since we don't want to overwhelm the user with options

- Instead of the projects being about reinforcing the lessons, the lessons are just preparation for the projects

- when the user presses the 'show solution' button we should have an optional modal that pops up asking why they did it.

- flashcards are automatically added like in learnjavascript.online

- popular highlights

- the user should be able to by default hide the editor on the sublesson instructions. Or maybe that's just the deault, that the editor is hiddden and a button expands it during the instructions

- we need to emphasize that they should only be using the text when they forget. Not skimming it then revisting it a bunch later

- fill in the missing parts of the code. For example:
  nextDecade(year) {
  return year + 10;
  }

  - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MDsEdtkCHGC10ZUasnVNqd5_iRbUUBPo86hLyPjmyGI/edit

- have a share page or modal pop up sometimes

  - if they sign up with your code, they'll instantly be friends/connected

- you can ask your friends questions. You ask a question and all your friends get notified

- project recap

- you can highligh something and suggest an imporvement (learnprogramming.online)

- you can bookmark sublessons or challenges

- if a challenge is hard, have a message with a ! icon above the tests that says "this challenge is hard so expect to spend extra time on it. Stay motivated! Direct them to the forums if necessary"

- so the top row of the content panel has two dropdowns, one fro lesson text length and one for challgen freuqnecy. For leson text length when the user has long selected but there is only medium, it'll show medium (preference: high) or something

- ability to set a daily learning goal like in duolingo or sololearn

  - IN THE SAME SPIRIT, YOU CAN START "SPRINTS" WHERE YOUR DAILY RATE IS HIGHER FOR LIKE A WEEK OR SOMETHING

- syntax handbook. It pops up on the right over the sublesson progress. it's like a list that you can search and then on the left of each item is a sideways facing carot that when you click it faces down and content expands below it (like the qa from dfuzr). In it is, idk, like an infographic for the syntax?

  - At the top of the handbook/list, have: "If you have to look up syntax to complete a challenge, DO NOT COPY PASTE THE SYNTAX. Type in the syntax manually, that way you can better learn the syntax for next time

- recommend that they type the examples that they see in the lessons!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

- ability to schedule a challenge to be seen in your 'due challenges' later. THis is great for when someone fails on a challenge

- most hints should be in pseudocode

- after a completes a challenge that they used a hint on, a modal should pop up asking if they want to add the challenge to their 'due challenges' so that they can practice it later

- debugging handbook. Has summaries for the googling lessons, error lessons, debugging lessons

- external resources should be called "additional resources"

- we should include hints for each 'google resource'. Two levels, the recommended query, and the result that says how to do it.

- since they submit it in the browser, they could add their solution in one click

- include tinkering in the mindset lesson. also include fixed vs growth

- peer instructions using a currency based system. earning the currency allows you to get help from someone above you. The currency maybe can even be converted to money at the top level. And maybe have some inspiration from the way that that coding interview thing you did did things? Remember where you would interview someone else and they would interview you? THat would basically provide some structure/tips to how to advise the student.

- when making your lessons, don't forget about _priming_ https://jarednielsen.com/teach-adults-code/

- when you create a ticket board, make sure it integrates with some sort of feature tracker like strapi has

- clarify that math isn't required

- ability to see sublessons from lesson map

- include a 'gain experience' button in the site
