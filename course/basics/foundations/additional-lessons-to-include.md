- improve your code with functions

- maybe the first lesson should be "common mistakes people make when interacting with computers" and talk about literalness, case sensitivity, that you have to look for just one character being wrong, etc

- that they should use the actual use case in the tests and just paste it into the editor to see what's logged

- lessons on refactoring bad code like repeating stuff (look at boki's stuff)
